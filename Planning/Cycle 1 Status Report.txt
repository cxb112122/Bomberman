On Sunday, we spent 3 hours to finish the UML diagram.

On Monday, we made our component and made the hero move by keyListener,
but we did not figure out how to make hero and bombs show on the same
frame. And did some try about text read. We spent 4 hours to do these.

On Tuesday, we changed the structure of this game and make GameComponent class
and tried to put all hero, monsters, bombs and walls in that class and paint.
The levels and walls can be read from the text file.We spent 5 hours to do these.

On Wednesday, we added the GameWorld class and put things all together. The hero can drop a bomb when press the "Space"and the keyListener works properly.We can do level up and 
down through "U""D" key.Users can control the hero through "<-","->""Up""Down" keys.
The hero can not get into the wall. The bomb can explode and kill monsters and hero. The monsters can kill hero. Once the hero is killed, it will go 
back to the start postion. We spent 5 hours to do these.
